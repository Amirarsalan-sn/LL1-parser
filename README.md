# LL1-parser
This is an LL1 parser developed with python, you can enter your grammer and see if it is LL1 or not (and why, if the grammer wasn't LL1).
If it was an LL1 grammer, the code will generate the production rules, first/follow/nullable table, parse table and RHS table for you. Then,
you can enter a string and ask the parser to parse it for you step by step.

## for full explanation of how the code works and how you can run and enter your inputs, see jupyter version of the project in "jupyter version" folder.
